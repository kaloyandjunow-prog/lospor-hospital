/**
 * Closes cases whose thirty-minute review window has elapsed.
 *
 * The countdown was client-side only: it ran in the summary screen, so a case
 * whose clinician closed the app before it expired stayed AWAITING_REVIEW
 * indefinitely -- for as long as nobody reopened it. "Auto-closes in 29:14" was
 * therefore a promise only a watching browser kept, which is not what an
 * automatic close means on a clinical record.
 *
 * `awaitingReviewAt` is the server's own stamp, written once on the transition
 * into AWAITING_REVIEW, so this needs no client and no per-browser clock.
 *
 * Two rules it must not break:
 *
 *  - **An incomplete case is never closed.** Finalization gates on complete
 *    documentation, and an expired window does not make a case ready. A
 *    blocked case backs off and is retried later, once whatever is missing has
 *    had time to be filled in.
 *
 *    That backoff is not politeness, it is the whole correctness of the job.
 *    This scan is bounded and ordered oldest-first, so a case that can never
 *    close used to be re-selected on every run for ever -- and twenty-five of
 *    them at the head of the queue meant the twenty-sixth was never examined
 *    at all, however complete it was. One ward's unfinished paperwork could
 *    silently stop automatic closure for the entire hospital, with nothing
 *    anywhere saying so. This comment previously called that "cheap and
 *    correct"; it was true of one case and false of the queue.
 *  - **The assignee signs it.** Letting the window run out is their decision as
 *    much as pressing Close Now, so the attestation carries their id -- under
 *    its own audit action, so the log can still tell an automatic close from a
 *    deliberate one.
