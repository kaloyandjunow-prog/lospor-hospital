/**
 * OMOP CDM v5.4 mapper — export contract `source_version` 3.8.0.
 *
 * `source_version` tracks the shape of the export, not the app version: bump it
 * whenever a table or column is added, removed or reinterpreted.
 *
 * 3.8.0 — the shape changes since 3.7.0, none of which had been released.
 *
 *         CARE_SITE is emitted as its own table and referenced by
 *         care_site_id, instead of the site being written onto
 *         VISIT_OCCURRENCE as a bare string.
 *
 *         Allergies stop being exported as DRUG_EXPOSURE. Medication.kind is
 *         CURRENT | ALLERGY, and the export iterated both, so a substance the
 *         patient reacts to was recorded as one they were given. Allergies now
 *         become observations, which is a different claim in the right place.
 *
 *         Continuous administrations gain drug_exposure_end_date, paired from
 *         their stop events. Every planned procedure is exported, not the
 *         first. Intraoperative drugs resolve their ATC through the same
 *         concept pipeline as relational medications.
 *
 *         Clinical yes/no questions emit for a recorded "no" as well as a
 *         "yes". They were nullable-free booleans, so silence was the only
 *         honest option; the columns are now nullable and silence means the
 *         question was never asked.
 *
 *         Airway management is exported: device list, Cormack-Lehane grade,
 *         tools, per-device sizes and cuff status, DLT type/side/size,
 *         endobronchial size, ventilation modes, IPPV, jet ventilation and
 *         PEEP. Placing an instrumented airway is also emitted as a
 *         PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE, separating what was done to the patient from
 *         what was true of them.
 *
 *         Preop findings that were read out of the database and written to no
 *         table now leave: smoking, substance use, latex allergy, family
 *         anaesthesia history, dental state, cardiac arrhythmia, BMI, blood
 *         group and Rh, GUTA, the airway examination (mouth opening,
 *         thyromental distance, neck mobility, upper lip bite test,
 *         retrognathia, prominent incisors, facial hair), and the free-text
 *         allergy, family-history and difficult-airway notes, redacted.
 *
 *         MEASUREMENT gains value_source_value, range_low and range_high.
 *         A lab result with no parsed number used to be skipped entirely, so a
 *         culture, a dipstick or a blood group left no trace of having been
 *         recorded; it is now exported with the value the lab reported. The
 *         reference range travels with the result, because ranges differ by
 *         laboratory, assay and patient age, and "high" is not a claim the
 *         export can support without the range that produced it. The abnormal
 *         flag rides as its own observation, keyed to the measurement's source
 *         value, since CDM 5.4 has no column for it.
 *
 *         Vascular lines carry their depth, lumen count and whether they were
 *         already in place. A pre-existing line was not placed during this
 *         case, so its procedure row overstates the work without that flag.
 *
 *         mapping_summary gains manually_curated_rows and rejected_rows.
 *         MAPPED covered both an automatic resolution and one a human signed
 *         off, and UNMAPPED covered both "nobody has looked" and "a candidate
 *         was rejected" -- so the summary could not distinguish evidence from
 *         guesswork, or finished review work from a backlog.
 * 3.7.0 — OBSERVATION gains value_as_number, the CDM column a numeric
 *         observation belongs in. Every score the export carries (RCRI, Apfel,
 *         STOP-BANG, the Aldrete subscores and total, POVOC, COLDS, PAED, the
 *         paediatric pain scales, fluid totals, durations) was written only as
 *         text, so a researcher could not sum, average or threshold one without
 *         casting it back. The string form is kept alongside for values that
 *         are genuinely textual and for consumers already reading it.
 * 3.6.0 — preserves pediatric mode, precise age, rule provenance, pediatric
 *         risk scores, and pediatric recovery scores as source observations.
 *         No unreviewed standard concept IDs are assigned.
 * 3.5.1 — production export includes real intraoperative start/end instants in
 *         the selected row shape, so visit dates use startedAt/endedAt when
 *         present instead of falling back to legacy wall-clock columns.
 * 3.5.0 — emits PERSON and OBSERVATION_PERIOD, the root tables the CDM and the
 *         OHDSI tools (ATLAS, ACHILLES) require; without them earlier bundles
 *         were OMOP-shaped but could not be loaded. person_id is now derived
 *         from SHA-256 (52 bits) instead of a 32-bit string hash that would
 *         have collided two unrelated cases onto one person around ~70k cases.
 * 3.4.x — drug exposure from CaseEvent rows; LOINC-coded lab measurements from
 *         LabResult; care_site_source_value from Case.institutionId.
 *
 * Concept IDs stay 0 where LOSPOR has no confident standard-vocabulary mapping
 * (vitals, which carry real LOINC-backed concept_ids, are the exception). No
 * identifier is ever invented — source vocabulary and code are carried instead.
