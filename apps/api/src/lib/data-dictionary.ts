// 4.4.0 adds what three monitors read, rather than only that they were on. The
// sixteen monitoring flags are yes/no for the whole case, so a BIS that sat at
// 55 and one that dropped to 22 for twenty minutes were the same record, as
// were a train-of-four of 0.9 and one of 0.4 at extubation. Depth of
// anaesthesia and adequacy of reversal are what these monitors exist to answer.
// Each value is bound to its flag and cleared with it, so a reading never
// outlives the monitor that produced it. CVP is stored and exported in mmHg
// whatever unit was typed: the entry unit is a per-user display preference and
// a column following it could not be pooled.
//
// 4.3.0 documents what the traceability pass found: the risk-score and COLDS
// factors, which exported their totals and not one component; the allergy flag,
// whose absence made a documented "no known allergies" identical to an unasked
// question; and the superseded storage -- JSON blobs and free-text columns a
// mirror table now carries -- which is marked rather than deleted, because an
// empty column called complications reads as "no complications".
//
// 4.2.0 adds bloodLossMl, the first intraoperative quantity a clinician enters
// that is not derivable from the fluid events. Crystalloids, colloids and blood
// products are projections of what was actually given; blood lost is an
// observation only the anaesthetist can make. NULL means not recorded, which is
// deliberately distinct from a recorded 0 mL.
//
// 4.1.0 points the entries at columns that exist. Twenty-six entries declared
// observation.value_as_number, a column the export did not have until
// source_version 3.7.0 added it; five more named a column by a name the export
// has never used (visit_start_datetime, visit_end_datetime, route_concept_id,
// and the anaesthesia techniques, which are procedure rows rather than
// observations). Every numeric allowed range is now the one the validator in
// @lospor/core enforces, rather than the narrower range that felt plausible
// when the entry was written: the dictionary said height 50-250 cm and weight
// 1-300 kg while the app has always accepted 20-280 and 0.1-700, so every
// neonate on file sat outside its own documented range and would have read as
// a data-quality problem. A test holds the two together from now on. Nothing
// has been exported under 4.0.0, so no dataset needs migrating.
//
// 4.0.0 renamed every source value to NAMESPACE:CODE and added height and
// weight, which were documented but never exported. Nothing had been exported
// under 3.x, so no dataset needs migrating.
