/**
 * The data dictionary is the published definition of a research export: what
 * each column means, its unit, its allowed values, and what a missing value
 * means. Researchers read it to interpret a dataset they have downloaded.
 *
 * Nothing checked it against the export it describes. The dictionary is a
 * hand-maintained list and the mapper is code, so the two drift apart silently:
 * a column gets renamed or a concept retired, the dictionary keeps the old
 * entry, and someone analyses a variable under the wrong definition. That
 * failure is invisible at the point it happens and surfaces, if ever, in
 * somebody's results.
 *
 * These tests compare the two directly. They are deliberately about the
 * *shape* of the contract — table names, concept codes, versions — rather than
 * about any one column, so adding a column to the export does not break them
 * unless it was added without being documented.
